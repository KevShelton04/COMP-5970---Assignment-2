<H2>Making Music</H2>
<p>One of my dreams in life has always been to become a widely known music artist. It all started with being inspired by artists like
Playboi Carti and Lil Yachty. 2 years ago I'd finally decided to begin chasing this dream by buying the tech needed to make music.
Ever since, I have fallen in love with craft and I hope to make something out of it one day!</p>
<H2>My Musical Background</H2>
<p>Growing up, I was one of those kids that was always really attached to the way that music sounded. I'd hum songs 24/7 and this is when I
knew that this was something for me. Throughout grade school, I was always involved in band and played every drum on drumline. This 
love for making beats transitioned into me becoming a music producer in 2022 when I first got to Auburn. Although I'd always wanted to 
be an artist, that wasn't even my original plan since I'd never done it. After making beats for roughly 2 years, I'd finally began 
diving into recording songs. Even though I mostly record now, I still find time to produce beats; it is a part of me that will never leave.</p>
