<H2>Gaming</H2>
<p>Video games have been a core part of my life for as long as I can rememeber. I'll never forget the feeling of holding a controller for
the first time and losing track of time while playing my favorite PS2 games. As I grew up, my dad always got me the next-generation
consoles that came out and I loved every single second. Today, I still consistently game and I even live stream to Twitch sometimes.</p>
<H2>My favorite game EVER</H2>
<p>My favorite game of all time has to be Elden Ring. Elden Ring is a souls-borne adventurer that involves exploring a huge map with several
biomes that have several boss fights within them. These bosses range in difficulty but are usually pretty hard to beat, but the challenge
is what I enjoy the most. I also enjoy the overall scenery that Elden Ring has to offer being that I am into medieval-themed entertainment.
Elden Ring also won Game of the Year in 2022.</p>
